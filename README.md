# TrustLens

### Your model has 92% accuracy. But can you trust it?

**TrustLens is the open-source library that answers the questions accuracy never does.**

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

You trained a model. It hits **92% accuracy** on your validation set.

So you ship it.

Three months later:
- A minority-class user gets consistently wrong predictions
- The model is 90% confident on its worst mistakes
- A regulator asks "why did it make that decision?" and you have no answer

**Accuracy tells you how often your model is right. It tells you nothing about when it fails, why it fails, or who it fails.**

TrustLens fixes that. In one function call.

## Quick Analyze (Zero-Friction Start)

Try TrustLens instantly without bringing your own data or models. We provide a zero-friction entry point:

```python
from trustlens import quick_analyze

# Automatically loads the breast cancer dataset, trains a baseline logic model, 
# and runs the full analysis, returning a TrustReport and rendering the dashboard.
report = quick_analyze(dataset="breast_cancer")
```

---

## Quick Usage with Custom Models

```bash
pip install trustlens
```

```python
from trustlens import analyze

report = analyze(
  model,     # any sklearn-compatible model
  X_val,     # validation features
  y_val,     # ground truth
  y_prob=proba,  # predicted probabilities
)

print(report.trust_score)
report.show()
```

**Output Insight:**

```text
==================================================================
  TrustLens Report
==================================================================
 Timestamp : 2026-04-16T15:43:02Z
 Model   : RandomForestClassifier
 Samples  : 2,500
 Classes  : 2

==================================================================
 TRUST SCORE: 61/100 [B]
 Assessment: Good Trust - minor issues to address
==================================================================

 Key Observations:
  * Calibration needs improvement (ECE > 0.1).
  * Model is overconfident on incorrect predictions (low confidence gap).

==================================================================
 Dimension breakdown:
  calibration    52.3/100 []
  failure      74.1/100 []
  bias        41.2/100 []
  representation   68.5/100 []
```

Your calibration is fine. Your bias score is not. **TrustLens just saved you a PR disaster.**

## The Summary Dashboard

One line. One picture. Everything you need.

```python
report.summary_plot()
```

The presentation-ready 6-panel dashboard shows:
- **Trust Score gauge**: Your model's overall trustworthiness at a glance
- **Reliability diagram**: Is your model overconfident or underconfident?
- **Confidence gap**: Does high confidence actually mean high accuracy?
- **Error rate by class**: Which classes are being failed?
- **Class distribution**: Is your training data biased?
- **Sub-score breakdown**: Which dimension needs the most work?

---

## The Trust Score

A single, actionable number: **0 to 100**.

Computed from four dimensions, each independently interpretable:

| Dimension | What it measures | Weight |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Calibration** | Do probabilities reflect reality? | 35% |
| **Failure** | Does confidence correlate with accuracy? | 30% |
| **Bias** | Are all groups treated equally? | 25% |
| **Representation** | Is the embedding space well-structured? | 10% |

| Score | Grade | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 80-100 | A | Production-ready |
| 60-79 | B | Good - fix flagged issues first |
| 40-59 | C | Investigate before deployment |
| 0-39 | D | Do not deploy |

## The Failure Showcase

Find your model's most dangerous mistakes in 1 line:

```python
report.show_failures(top_k=5)
```

**Output:**

```text
==================================================================
 TOP 5 CRITICAL FAILURES
 GradientBoostingClassifier | 58 total errors / 700 samples (8.3%)
==================================================================
 #  Sample  True  Pred  Confidence  Danger
 ------------------------------------------------------
 1  412     1   0    97.4%  CRITICAL
 2  88     0   1    95.1%  CRITICAL
 3  301     1   0    91.8%  HIGH
 4  556     0   1    89.2%  HIGH

 Insights:
   Mean confidence on top failures: 93.4%
   These are high-confidence mistakes - the model is
   certain it is right, but it is wrong.
   Overconfidence detected - consider calibration.
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Medical AI
A diagnostic model with 94% accuracy has an ECE of 0.18 - dangerously overconfident on edge cases. TrustLens surfaces it before deployment.

### Fraud Detection
Your model's confidence gap is 0.04 - it's almost as confident on fraud it misses as on fraud it catches. That's your false-negative problem, quantified.

### Hiring, Loan, and Insurance
Subgroup analysis reveals a 23% accuracy gap between applicant demographics. You have a fairness problem. Now you know before a regulator tells you.

### Research
Use CKA to compare representation quality across model architectures. Use faithfulness testing to benchmark explanation methods honestly.

## Contributing

TrustLens is designed to grow with the community. Adding a new metric takes just four simple steps:

> **Testing Policy:** Current test coverage is 67% to ensure core stability. It will be incrementally improved toward 85%+ as advanced modules (e.g., explainability, visualization) receive additional tests. All new contributions must maintain or improve this baseline.

1. Write a pure function `my_metric(y_true, y_pred) -> float`
2. Add it to the appropriate module (`metrics/calibration.py`, etc.)
3. Export it from `metrics/__init__.py`
4. Write a test in `tests/test_<module>.py`

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full guide including instructions on adding plugins and explainability methods.
Review `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES.md` for open tasks ready to be developed.

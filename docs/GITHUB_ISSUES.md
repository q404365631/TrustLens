### Issue #1: Add Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) metric
**Label:** `good first issue`, `metrics`
**Description:**
MCE is the maximum (worst-case) calibration gap across all confidence bins.
Unlike ECE which averages across bins, MCE highlights the single worst miscalibrated region.

**Expected output:**
```python
from trustlens.metrics.calibration import maximum_calibration_error
mce = maximum_calibration_error(y_true, y_prob) # float in [0, 1]
```
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### Issue #7: Add `SpearmanCorrelation` between confidence and correctness
**Label:** `good first issue`, `metrics`
**Description:**
Compute Spearman rank correlation between `max_confidence` and `is_correct`.
Higher correlation → model's confidence better tracks accuracy.
Add to `failure.py` as `confidence_correctness_correlation(y_true, y_pred, y_prob)`.
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### Issue #13: Add `TrustReport.to_dict()` serialization method
**Label:** `good first issue`, `api`
**Description:**
Add a `to_dict()` method to `TrustReport` that returns all results as a flat Python dictionary (JSON-compatible).
This enables users to log results to tools like MLflow or W&B.
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### Issue #19: Add HTML report export via `report.to_html()`
**Label:** `enhancement`, `reporting`
**Description:**
Add a `to_html()` method that generates a self-contained HTML report with:
- Embedded base64 PNG plots
- Metric tables with color-coded cells (green=good, red=bad)
- Collapsible sections per module
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #20: Add `critical_failures()` method to `TrustReport`
**Label:** `enhancement`, `api`
**Description:**
Add a method that returns the top-N highest-confidence misclassifications across all classes.

```python
failures = report.critical_failures(n=20)
# Returns DataFrame: index, y_true, y_pred, confidence
```
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #22: Add UMAP/t-SNE visualization for embeddings
**Label:** `enhancement`, `visualization`
**Description:**
In `trustlens/visualization/representation_plots.py`, add `plot_embedding_2d()`:
- Compute 2D projection using UMAP (preferred) or t-SNE (fallback)
- Color points by class label
- Add legend and silhouette score annotation
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #2: Add per-class accuracy metric to failure analysis
**Label:** `good first issue`, `metrics`
**Description:**
Accuracy is often misleading in imbalanced datasets. We need to complement the `misclassification_summary` with a straightforward dictionary of per-class accuracy values.

**Task:**
Implement `per_class_accuracy(y_true, y_pred) -> dict` in `trustlens/metrics/failure.py`.

**Expected output:**
```python
acc = per_class_accuracy(y_true, y_pred)
# {0: 0.943, 1: 0.872}
```
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### Issue #3: Add shared pytest fixtures via conftest.py
**Label:** `good first issue`, `testing`
**Description:**
As the test suite grows, we are seeing significant boilerplate duplication in dataset creation. We should centralize common test assets using a root-level `conftest.py`.

**Task:**
Create `tests/conftest.py` and implement the following fixtures:
- `binary_dataset`: A tuple of small NumPy arrays for binary classification.
- `multiclass_dataset`: A 3-class dataset for verifying the upcoming multi-class support.
- `trained_rf`: A pre-fitted `RandomForestClassifier` to avoid training time in every test.

**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### Issue #10: Fix visualization crash for single-class edge case
**Label:** `bug`, `visualization`
**Description:**
The `plot_class_distribution()` function assumes the presence of at least two classes. When provided with a single-class dataset (common in filtered data or specific edge cases), it raises a `ValueError` or crashes during plotting.

**Task:**
Add a safety guard in `trustlens/visualization/bias_plots.py` to handle 1-item class distributions gracefully. Instead of crashing, it should display a warning message or a simplified bar chart.

**Test case:**
```python
# This should no longer crash
report = class_imbalance_report(np.zeros(50, dtype=int))
plot_class_distribution(report)
```
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

### Issue #28: Add tqdm progress bars to analyze()
**Label:** `enhancement`, `ux`
**Description:**
The `analyze()` pipeline can take several seconds when multiple compute-intensive modules (like representation or large-scale calibration) are active. Users currently get no feedback until the entire report is built.

**Task:**
Integrate `tqdm` into the main `analyze()` loop in `trustlens/api.py`.
- The progress bar should only show when `verbose=True`.
- `tqdm` must remain an **optional dependency**. The code should use a fallback (e.g., logging) if `tqdm` is not installed.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #34: Add MLflow integration for logging TrustReport
**Label:** `enhancement`, `integrations`
**Description:**
TrustLens results are often part of a larger experiment tracking workflow. We want to make it seamless to log a `TrustReport` directly to an active MLflow run.

**Task:**
Add a new integration module `trustlens/integrations/mlflow.py` with a `log_trust_report(report, run=None)` function.
Properties to log:
- Scalar metrics (Brier, ECE, individual trust scores) as MLflow metrics.
- High-level metadata.
- Plots (summary plot, reliability diagrams) as MLflow artifacts.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #35: Add Weights & Biases (W&B) integration for TrustReport logging
**Label:** `enhancement`, `integrations`
**Description:**
W&B is a primary experiment tracker. Users currently have to manually flatten reports or use `to_dict()` and `wandb.log()`. A first-class integration would handle metrics, metadata, and plots automatically.

**Task:**
Implement `trustlens.integrations.wandb.log_trust_report(report)`:
- Logs metrics via `wandb.log()`
- Logs reliability diagram via `wandb.Image()`
- Automatically initializes a run if one doesn't exist.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #25: Add `equalized_odds` metric to bias module — the fairness gold standard
**Label:** `enhancement`, `fairness`
**Description:**
Subgroup accuracy gap tells you *if* one group is worse off. Equalized Odds tells you *how* they're worse off — through predictive bias in TPR or FPR.

**Task:**
Add `equalized_odds(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features) → dict` to `trustlens/metrics/bias.py`.
- Compute per-group TPR and FPR.
- Calculate the maximum disparity (gap) between groups.
- Label the violation as "severe" (>0.15), "moderate" (0.05-0.15), or "acceptable" (<0.05).

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #51: Add a powerful CLI entry point: `trustlens analyze`
**Label:** `enhancement`, `ux`
**Description:**
Empower users to perform high-fidelity model audits directly from the terminal without writing a single line of Python.

**Task:**
Implement `trustlens analyze` with support for built-in datasets and local files.
- Command: `trustlens analyze --dataset breast_cancer`
- Command: `trustlens analyze --data path/to/data.csv --model path/to/model.pkl`
- Use `typer` for the CLI framework and register it as a console script.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

---

### Issue #5
**Title:** Improve docstring for `analyze()` with a full code example
**Label:** `good first issue`, `docs`
**Description:**
The `analyze()` docstring has a brief example.
Expand the `Examples` section with a 10-line runnable code snippet using `make_classification`.

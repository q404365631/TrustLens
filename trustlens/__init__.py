"""
TrustLens — Debug your ML models beyond accuracy.

TrustLens is a modular Python library for analyzing the reliability and
trustworthiness of machine learning models beyond standard metrics.

Core capabilities include:
- Calibration analysis (Brier Score, ECE, reliability diagrams)
- Failure analysis (misclassifications, confidence gaps)
- Explainability (Grad-CAM, Eigen-CAM)
- Faithfulness testing (pixel deletion/insertion)
- Bias detection (subgroup performance, class imbalance)
- Representation analysis (embedding geometry, CKA)
- Trust Score (0–100 composite reliability metric)
